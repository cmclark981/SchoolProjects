As part of my CS-210 module 8 assignment, this is a project reflection submission. 

CS-210 Module 8 Journal Assignment Project Reflection

My submission for this assingment is the CS-210 Module 3 Project 1 source file. I have chosen this 
project file due to the exmplary credit I received for my effort. In this assigment we were to code a 
menu for two clocks. One was 12-hour and the other was 24-hour. We were provided a flowchart and given 
direction on what we needed to complete this assignment. 

Initially we had to clear the screen, then display both clocks per the functional requirements. We had to
develop a menu for user input. There were four options to add second, minute or hour, then exit. The clocks
were required to update based on user input. 

I believe this coding assingment we one of my better submissions. it is clear and readable. My comments 
are input as instructed and I have cited all resources properly. The code functioned as required. 

After completing other assignments, I realized I could have used a switch() statment with cases for each menu
option. I could have called functions from the case operations. This would probably have been a better option
given industry standards. 

this wa the first time I had been required to utilize classes. Trying to understand the differencde between
public and private and where to use them was new. I have come to usdertand how classes make code better 
organized and readable. 

Moving forward I have taken lessons from this prject and applied them to other assignments. I have grown to
apprciate the style for adding comments. Using multi-line commentary above the section you are describing
breaks up the code and helps to make clear what the original designer had in mind. 

By using the standard we were taught through ZyBooks, and leaving good comments where applicable, this code 
should be easy for others to understand and maintain. I have kept everything spaced properly and coded to the
standard I had learned at that time. I realize this is a basic program, but there was much to learn and build 
on here.
